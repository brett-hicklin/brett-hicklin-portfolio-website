# Brett Hicklin's Portfolio website

## Description

This website was created to act as my portfolio, and to also show what I've learned so far in HTML and CSS. I wanted to make the website look as presentable as I could given my knowledge, so that I can update  it as I learn more about coding,and have a good starting point. I will hopefully be able to expand my "Work" collection to more impressive objects.
